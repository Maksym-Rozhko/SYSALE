### Page development: :bangbang:
  * Added adaptive/responsive; :white_check_mark:
  * Make smooth hover (for all) and click (for some) buttons; :white_check_mark:
  * Deploy on click, implement color selection (take into account the slider and the fact that there will be more color options below). When moving the cursor out of the block, close the select. It is important to do the drop-down list without using the select tag. :white_check_mark:
  * Make a change to the image on hover (replace the image according to the example in the left interaction block); :white_check_mark:
  * Used pure JS; :white_check_mark:
  * Product volume - default 100 ml, displacement selection added; :white_check_mark:
  * Completed quantity selection (next to the buy button) made as base 1 (you cannot get less) implemented an increase and decrease in the number of goods; :white_check_mark:
  * A bunch of prices and volumes of goods will be a plus; :x:
